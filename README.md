## <ins>Installation</ins>: 
### Installer for Windows users
In the last release, look up for the `TDQuickerInstaller.exe` file. After downloading it, launch it and follow the instructions shown in the installer. 

Once done, TDQuicker should be useable! 

****

### Using Python (For Mac & Linux)

You need [python3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed. 

> __Warning__: The `shiboken6` package (used by `PySide6`) seems to not work on all python version, so you need `python3.x â‰¥ python3.7`. 

You will also need to install this package:
* [X] **PySide6**: `pip install PySide6` 
> __Note__: it will install other required packages like `shiboken6`, ...

> __Note__: You can also use: `pip install -r requirements.txt` which will check other preinstalled packages as well. 

The app also uses these already installed packages:
* [X] **datetime** 
* [X] **time** 
* [X] **re** 

****

Once your python is set up, you can follow these instructions:
1. Clone the git: 
```git
git clone git@github.com:GaecKo/TDQuicker.git
```
2. Place yourself in the git directory
```bash
cd TDQuicker
```
3. You can then launch the `.py` file: 
```bash
python TDQuicker.py
``` 
> __Warning__: You may need to use `python3` as a command instead of `python`

## <ins>Known Issues</ins>:

> __Note__: A few issues are currently known. 

1. Task alignment when the scroll bar is not shown: 
	* I have tried a lot of things to fix this, but without any result... 

2. Height of the task boxes:
	* The height of the boxes containing the task is not responsive. I couldn't figure how to make it have a good height without making the text scrollable. 

3. Sticky mode refresh the window:
	* That's not a huge problem but it's not looking fantastic... I don't even know if it is possible to avoid that. 

4. Scroll text appears unexpectedly on mac:
	* On mac, the `QTextEdit()` widget seems to enjoy making the zone scrollable and thus making it hard to read and focus, especially on small text.

* If you have any idea on how to fix these bugs or if you see any other: [Pull Requests](https://github.com/GaecKo/TDQuicker/pulls) and [Issues](https://github.com/GaecKo/TDQuicker/issues) are good places to let me know!
